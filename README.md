# chaos attractors visualization

this repository explores chaotic attractors, including the **lorenz attractor**, **rössler attractor**, and **qi-chen attractor**. these mathematical systems exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions, making them fundamental in chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics.

## attractors included
- **lorenz attractor**: a system of three differential equations originally developed as a simplified model of atmospheric convection.  
- **rössler attractor**: a three-dimensional system with a single nonlinear term, known for its simpler structure yet chaotic behavior.  
- **qi-chen attractor**: a lesser-known but complex chaotic system with unique phase-space structures.  

## features
- visualizations rendered using **processing**.  
- real-time 3d visualizations of the attractors.  
- adjustable parameters for experimentation.  

## installation
clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/atharvakokane/strange-attractors.git  
cd strange-attractors
